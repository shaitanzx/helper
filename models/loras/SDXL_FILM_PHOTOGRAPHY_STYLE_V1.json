    "notes": "<!--\nVersion 1.0 is finally here! I have worked very hard to ensure that I trained on high-quality, well captioned images, but I still am not an expert! If anyone has any SDXL LORA Training tips, let me know!!! \n\nI am trying to reduce the bias in my model, but it's been very difficult (for example, asking for a \"handyman\" will produce mostly white men).\n-->",
